This is an example application created using the Domain Driven Design pattern and Spring Boot.

The goal of this project is to expose APIs that can be used to handle 
many wallets and their transactions.

## Architecture

The application is divided into 3 layers:

* **Domain**: contains the business logic and the domain entities
* **Service**: contains the application services
* **Controller**: contains the REST controllers
